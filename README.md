This project aims to explore the functionality of MongoDB and learn about the POST and GET methods, as well as generating dynamic URLs. By utilizing MongoDB for data persistence, the project enables the creation and retrieval of blog posts using these HTTP methods. The dynamic URLs ensure direct access to each blog post, providing an intuitive browsing experience. It is an opportunity to enhance web development skills and practice essential backend concepts.
